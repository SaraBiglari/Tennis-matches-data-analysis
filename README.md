# Tennis-matches-data-analysis
Analyze 2 month of tennis matches data to discover trends and meaningful insights 


In this tennis data analysis project, I focused on four main aspects:

Data Preprocessing: Combined datasets from two months and organized the data based on a given schema to create structured, analysis-ready tables.

Metric Calculation: Computed key statistics such as average match duration, the average number of aces per match, average number of sets played in games and etc.

Pattern Discovery: Investigated relationships between different variables, such as the correlation between player height and ranking.

Behavioral Analysis by Gender: Explored and compared behavioral patterns between male and female players—such as differences in the average number of double faults—to identify meaningful trends and insights.
